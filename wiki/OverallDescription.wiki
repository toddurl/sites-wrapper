= Overall Description =

What makes SitesWrapper different is that the overall look and feel of the presentation interface can be changed to match some of the webs most popular sites without affecting the content or functionality. The content on the other hand, which is generated using Google Apps and deployed as a collection of Google Sites, gets “wrapped” and presented homogeneously as a SitesWrapper site. The configuration of a SitesWrapper site (as opposed to the content), is dictated by the application data model which is maintained as a collection of persistent objects in the Google App Engine Datastore and updated by the individual configuration clients via Google Cloud Messaging.

== Product Perspective ==

SitesWrapper is composed of five distinct software components. Two of the components, the server service wrapper and the client wrapper share a common source tree and are maintained as part of the same eclipse project, SitesWrapper-AppEngine-GWT. The other three items, which are maintained and distributed separately, are the Android, iOS and Apps Script based configuration clients; SitesWrapper-Android, SitesWrapper-iOS and SitesWrapper-AppsScript respectively.
