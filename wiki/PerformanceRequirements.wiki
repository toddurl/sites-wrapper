  * *Android Configuration Client* - Must be smooth, responsive, use as little battery as possible. In general, the client software must follow the practices identified in the [http://developer.android.com/training/best-performance.html Best Practices for Performance] section of the Android developers guide. The following specific requirements must be verified on a continuous basis as a consequence of testing the Functional requirements identified in the Android Configuration Client section of the Functional Requirements section of this wiki and must be included in the Test Summary Report for each release of SitesWrapper.
    # All view swipes must be smooth and non-blocking.
    # Application launch time from the device powered off state, or initial launch state to power up must not take more that 5 seconds. That is from onCreate() to onResumed().
