#summary Identifies functions of SitesWrapper or one of its component.

= Functional Requirements =

This section of the wiki identifies the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement functional requirements] of SitesWrapper, which for the most part comprises [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case use cases] associated with each of the various components of SitesWrapper; the Android Configuration Client, the iOS Configuration Client, the Apps Script Configuration Client, the Server Service Wrapper and the Client Wrapper.

Use cases defined in each subsection shall have a corresponding one to one relationship with every functional [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Case test case], each of which shall be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_script scripted] and grouped together forming a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_suite test suite] covering the functionality of the associated component of SitesWrapper.

== Language ==

The language used in each use case of each functional requirement for each subsection of this section shall be definitive, and dictate the language used for each deliverable associated with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process Software Development Lifecycle] of SitesWrapper including, but not limited to, test cases, test scripts, test suites and test summary reports.

For example, the title of the use case shall be used as the title of the corresponding test case as well as the title of the corresponding test script, and shall be used to identify the use case within the corresponding test suite as well as the test summary report.

In the case that new language is required or created as part of any other deliverable, that language shall be back ported and incorporated into the corresponding use case so that the usage of the language is once again consistent across the deliverables associated with the SDLC.

For example, if a unique identifier is created as part of writing a test case, that unique identifier (_i.e._; test case id) shall be incorporated into the language of the corresponding use case and used were and if required in the corresponding test script, test suite and test summary report.
