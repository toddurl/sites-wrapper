# Memory Constraints #

SitesWrapper is not expected to place excessive demands on system memory and is expected to behave appropriately on a per platform basis memory management systems indicate memory is unavailable.

If your app has reached the heap capacity and tries to allocate more memory, it will receive an OutOfMemoryError.
